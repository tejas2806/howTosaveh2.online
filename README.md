# How To Save Water Online

## What is How to save Water online

Howtosaveh2.online is a simple device that effectively helps people track their water consumption. It keeps track of your daily water and light consumption. To encourage people to save water, we have also included a rewards system. A one-up for environment-friendly practices.

## Inspiration

Around 700 million people in 43 countries suffer today from water scarcity. By 2025,  two-thirds of the world's population could be living under water-stressed conditions. Through a few studies, we understood that cutting down on water usage in the washroom for one minute could result in massively saving 8 liters of water every washroom session. 

## What it does

How to save water online is a simple device that effectively helps people track their water consumption. It keeps track of your daily water and light consumption. To encourage people to save water, we have also included a rewards system. A one-up for environment-friendly practices.

## How we built it

ESP8266 with LDR, water-flow sensor, humidity, and temperature sensors to sense light and shower events. The device sends the data to a Firebase database where our website pulls data from. The web app was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Google Charts, and amCharts APIs. 

## Challenges we ran into

Figuring out how to assemble the hardware into a small form was one of the most difficult parts. We wanted the hardware to be cost-effective and light-weight. We are most proud of the UI/UX design that animates upon loading, giving the app a modern feel.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Creating a project which helps our environment and community.
Working in unison despite being far away from each other.
Completing this awesome project within a very short amount of time.

## What we learned
- We have learned to use `Firebase` with the `NodeMCU` Board to send Data to MySQL
  Server,
- Explored Some cool data visualization Softwares over Website `Amchart`, etc

## What's next for How to save water online 

We are looking to include toilet flushing data on top of the shower and light data. In addition, we would like to create an even smaller device with cheaper and waterproof components to further increase practicality. 

## Built With

We sautered an ESP8266 with a photoresistor, water-flow sensor, humidity, and temperature sensors to sense light and shower events. The device sends the data to a Firebase database where our website pulls data from. The web app was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Google Charts, and amCharts APIs.
